# _SettleIt V2_

#### _This app will dynamically generate settle sheets for entertainment venues, 2/12/2019_

#### By _**Charley McGowan**_

## Description

_Performers at gigs need a way to clearly see the payout for the evening based on a multitude of factors. At the most basic level, it's typically a payout after a certain amount of tickets have been sold, but it can also have many other factors involved, such as merchandise sales, or a cut of the bar sales. Designing a dynamic way to track each of these possible income sources is valuable for both the performing artist, and the venue they perform at._
