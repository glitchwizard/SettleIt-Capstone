# SettleItFrontEnd

#### Front end of tools for Live Entertainment Venues

#### By Charley McGowan

## Description

This readme is for the front end only of SettleIt, a settlement sheet (AKA settle sheet) generator for entertainment venues. The first of many tools to be made available to help music venues 500 capacity and below.

A settle sheet can be as complex as what's shown below:

## Stretch Goals
* Calendar Build out to see and organize settle sheets from a calendar view
* Organize performances by date via calendar view
* Email settle sheets to customer upon completion
* Build out entire tool suite for entertainment venues communication needs

## Setup/Installation Requirements

Software you'll need installed:

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. [.NET core 2.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (if you want to run the back end too)
3. [Visual Studio Community 2017](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) or [VS CODE](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) (or your favorite code editor)

* If you just want the front end, clone this directory [SettleIt-Capstone/SettleItFrontEnd/](https://github.com/glitchwizard/SettleIt-Capstone/tree/master/SettleItFrontEnd)
* From your terminal run "npm install" to get all the node modules you'll need
* From terminal run "npm run start" to get the dev server up and running, navigate to "http://localhost:8080" to get see the front end. A lot of functionality may not be possible though because it will also need to back end API, found here: [SettleIt-Capstone/SettleItAPI/](https://github.com/glitchwizard/SettleIt-Capstone/tree/master/SettleItAPI)

The ideal setup is to download the entire project from the [SettleIt-Capstone](https://github.com/glitchwizard/SettleIt-Capstone) repository and run both the back end and front end at the same time. 

If you choose to do this, follow these steps: 

* Clone from [SettleIt-Capstone](https://github.com/glitchwizard/SettleIt-Capstone) to your machine
* Navigate to "SettleIt-Capstone/SettleItAPI/" in your terminal, and run "dotnet run"
* Navigate to the "SettleIt-Capstone/SettleItFrontEnd/" folder in your terminal and run "npm install" to get the node modules.
